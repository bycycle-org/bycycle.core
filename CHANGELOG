* 2007-04-24:
    * Made changes necessary to get normaddr service tests to pass
    * Made changes necessary to get all but one geocode service tests to pass
* 2007-04-25
    * Made changes necessary to get ALL geocode service tests to pass
* 2007-04-26
    * Made changes necessary to get ALL tests to pass, including for routes
    * Changed Node and Edge inheritance so that subclasses classes point at
      base classes (with a Foreign Key) instead of the other way around.
      Base classes now have no knowledge of subclasses.
* 2007-04-27
    * Made changes necessary to get route tests to pass AND be *meaningful*;
      previously, the tests were passing, but the edges were out of order
      due to the fact that doing a "SELECT ... IN ..." doesn't necessarily
      return rows in the same order as the IDs in the IN clause.
    * Made some incidental changes affecting routing also.
* 2007-05-01
    * Removed address unification scheme. It didn't accomplish very well what
      is was trying to accomplish, and there are better ways of locating an
      address when the number is not in range for a given street name (A: make
      sure address ranges are all correct, B: search for the edge with the
      address range that has the smallest delta from the input number).
* 2007-05-02
    * Went back to schema scheme (each region has it's own schema). This
      removes some complexity and fixes some issues with locating the
      correct attributes for edges and nodes.
