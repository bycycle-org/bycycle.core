0.5a1 (2012-12-07)
------------------

Made changes necessary to get things back up and running. Made a few other
changes to clean things up a bit.

- Using str06oct from the Pirate network, because that's the only data set
  I could find in backups. I have no idea how up-to-date/out-of-date it is.

- Upgraded all dependencies to latest versions; removed unused. Almost no
  changes were required by these upgrades; there was one tiny change to
  a method signature in our user-defined SQLAlchemy geometry type, and I think
  that was it... oh, and SQLError was renamed to SQLAlchemyError.

- Added glineenc dependency; removed local copy.

- Upgraded to Dijkstar 2 and simplified graph-related code. Creation of
  regional adjacency matrix is simpler; splitting of edges in Route service is
  much simpler.

- Updated INSTALL doc to reflect latest Ubuntu packages. Also cleaned it up
  some.

- Improved memory usage during matrix creation (process batches of edges
  instead of all at once).

- Converted integrate and matrix scripts to proper console scripts (using
  argparse and console_scripts entry point).

- Renamed Geocode.xy_ll to lat_long; added Route.linestring_lat_long.

- Removed Milwaukee, Wisconsin, region.

- Cleaned up tests; added more.

- Cleaned up some cruft (unused files and whatnot).

- Various other small improvements and cleanup; see `hg diff -r
  bycycle-is-back:tip` for more details.


Ancient History (<= 0.4)
------------------------

SVN
* 2007-04-24:
    * Made changes necessary to get normaddr service tests to pass
    * Made changes necessary to get all but one geocode service tests to pass
* 2007-04-25
    * Made changes necessary to get ALL geocode service tests to pass
* 2007-04-26
    * Made changes necessary to get ALL tests to pass, including for routes
    * Changed Node and Edge inheritance so that subclasses classes point at
      base classes (with a Foreign Key) instead of the other way around.
      Base classes now have no knowledge of subclasses.
* 2007-04-27
    * Made changes necessary to get route tests to pass AND be *meaningful*;
      previously, the tests were passing, but the edges were out of order
      due to the fact that doing a "SELECT ... IN ..." doesn't necessarily
      return rows in the same order as the IDs in the IN clause.
    * Made some incidental changes affecting routing also.
* 2007-05-01
    * Removed address unification scheme. It didn't accomplish very well what
      is was trying to accomplish, and there are better ways of locating an
      address when the number is not in range for a given street name (A: make
      sure address ranges are all correct, B: search for the edge with the
      address range that has the smallest delta from the input number).
* 2007-05-02
    * Went back to schema scheme (each region has it's own schema). This
      removes some complexity and fixes some issues with locating the
      correct attributes for edges and nodes.
